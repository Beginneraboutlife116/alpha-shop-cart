# alpha-shop-cart
This project is my recent practice for using SCSS to layout a shop cart called alpha shop.</br>
And also, I try to practice webpack for bundling whole my scss, javascripts files.</br>
It takes time to have research about how to use webpack.</br>
And I have increase dark mode toggle to it.</br>
